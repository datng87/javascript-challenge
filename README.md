On this webpage, I created a table dynamically based upon a UFO sighting dataset. It also allows users to filter the table data for specific values using multiple filters.

Tool used: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.

The demo website can be found here: ## https://datng87.github.io/javascript-filters/
